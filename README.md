# World Weather Analysis for Vacation Search and Itinerary

## The objective of this analysis was to:
* Add the weather description to the weather data we retrieved in this module. 
* Then, have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
* From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. 
* Using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## As a result, this beta tester created a travel route in Mexico!
